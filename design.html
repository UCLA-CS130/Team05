        <p><strong>Echo Handler</strong></p>

        to the client-side browser.

            <p><strong>Static File Handler</strong></p>
            <p>Description: Statically serves a file from a given root
            directory given the following URI: /. Some example files 
            for one to play with design.html and markdown.md
            If the file path could not be found, it      
            returns a 404 Not Found Handler response. We added also
            another feature that provides markdown conversion from .md
            files to .html files given proper markdown syntax, using a
            cpp-markdown library.

        <p><strong>Reverse Proxy Handler</strong></p>
        <p>Description: This acts as a reverse proxy to talk to the 
        remote_host www.ucla.edu and remote_port 80 that also handles
        redirects (302s). This was not implemented by our team and the 
        functionality or appearance of the site may not be perfect.
        </p>
        <p>Usage: <a href="http://54.213.82.160:2020/reverse_proxy">

    <li>
        <p><strong>Status Handler</strong></p>
        <p>Description: This keeps track of all the requests made to the
        server with response codes associated with the requests, 
        outputted in a nice table format. We made sure to include mutex
        locking to make sure our data is thread-safe in having a
        singleton object hold the request handler history.
